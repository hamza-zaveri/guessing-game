Guessing Game created in C

  It gives two option when we run guess.c, first if you want to guess the number and second if you want to give the secret number and let computer guess it.
  -> If user chooses first option :
    We have to run the player.c file in order to continue with the game, here player.c will act as client and guess.c will act as server. In this we have 
    sockets and signals.
 -> If user chooses second option : 
    you have to give a number and let pc guess which number you choose, you need to tell pc if the number written if higher than your given number or lower
    . We have used signals, fork and pipe in the program
